<h1>osTicket - Post-Install Configuration</h1>
This lab demonstrates the post-installation configuration of osTicket to replicate how a real IT help desk is structured and managed.  
After deploying osTicket, I configured roles, departments, teams, SLAs, and help topics to simulate a functioning support environment â€” similar to what Tier 1/2 IT support techs work with daily.<br />




<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Internet Information Services (IIS)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Post-Install Configuration Objectives</h2>

- Configure Roles
- Configure Departments
- Configure Teams
- Configure Agents and Users
- Configure SLA Plans and Help Topics

<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>

</p>
<p>
Configure workers  Admin Panel -> Agents -> Add New
Jane (Dept: SysAdmins) John (Dept: Support) make sure to check there passwords so they may change it once there logged in for security

</p>
<p>
Configure SLA head to admin panel â€” manage â€”- sla 
We added our first SLA SLA-A our urgent one and we will add 2 more  Sev-A (Grace Period: 1 hour, Schedule: 24/7) Sev-B (Grace Period: 4 hours, Schedule: 24/7) Sev-C (Grace Period: 8 hours, Business Hours)

It should look like this

</p>
<p>
Configure  help topics (For when users create a ticket)
Admin Panel â€” Manage â€” Help Topics   Business Critical Outage, Personal Computer Issues, Equipment Request, Password Reset,  Other

</p>

##  Why This Matters
Post-install configuration transforms osTicket from just a ticketing app into a functional support environment.  

This mirrors real-world IT service desk setups where:
- Departments & Teams** = ticket routing & ownership  
- Roles = access control  
- SLAs = service expectations & escalation  
- Help Topics = user-friendly ticket categorization

 Skills shown here are directly used in Tier 1 / Tier 2 IT roles.

## ðŸ§ª Lessons Learned
- Setting up SLAs and help topics greatly improves ticket flow clarity.
- Proper team and role structure makes onboarding new agents easier.
- Understanding the admin panel in osTicket builds a foundation for other enterprise ticketing systems
